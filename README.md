A Flutter project.

## How to run

Running on a simulator (iOS or Android) or on an Android device:

```
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```
The flag is needed because the project uses a lib that doesn't support null-safety yet.

To run on an iOS device, you need Xcode and an Apple Account.

There are also some tests, to run them type:

```
flutter test
```

## Kanban board

A simpler version of a kanban board was used on development, please check it out at [Docnews project](https://github.com/julianapinheiro/docnews/projects/1).
Some features and bugs are missing due to time restrictions and are listed on the **To do** column
